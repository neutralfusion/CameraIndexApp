# ðŸ“¸  CameraIndexApp 
Android application based on Java which is indexing different cameras, lenses and accesories along with 
their specifications, guides, downloadable content, reviews, tips and tricks.

## ðŸ’¡  Brief description of the application and the motivation behind it:

The CameraIndex Android application came from the initial ideea of an application to be developed for the Android Course (IT-AND1X-S22) at VIA University College that was an online store where photographers could sell their pictures or stock images as prints. 
Studying the problem more, the conclusion was that a camera hardware and accesories indexing app would be more useful for a photographer that needs a decision towards buying and using camera gear. This app is proposing to create a database where the client can easily find specifications, reviews, tips and tricks about gear and other hardware resources related to photography.
